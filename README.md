**PHARMACY SUPPLY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
<br>
Pharmacy Supply Management in healthcare systems is evaluated with a particular focus on the distribution of medicines from a wholesaler to clinics. Currently, there are issues with service levels to clinics that need addressing. The value of the paper arises from providing a detailed analysis of a healthcare supply chain in the developing world and diagnosis the parameters involved in inventory. Pharmaceutical practices have evolved over time to become fully encompassed in all aspects of pharmacy itself. Such practices include: dispensing of drugs, consultation, drug regulation, and the sale of these drugs.Creating an Online Pharmaceutical Management System would help in pharmaceutical practices for all parties involved. It is eminent that the system provides a safe, secure and verified platform for all parties which help to bridge the communication gap and provide legitimate drugs. Therefore, if all recommendations are strictly adhered to, there will be strict monitoring and regulation of how drugs are circulated and a decrease in the spread of fake drugs.

**CASE STUDY**
<br>
Rising debt, cost-cutting, and layoffs in health care-delivery facilities, alluded to earlier. Models for the design and operation of supply chain networks may be steady state or dynamic and may be deterministic or deal with uncertainties (particularly in product demands). Research in this field started very early on, with location-allocation problems forming part of the earlier set of ‘‘classical’’ operations research problems. The gap between the growing demand and available supply of high-quality, cost effective, and timely health care continues to be a daunting challenge not only in developing and underdeveloped countries, but also in developed countries. Further, the issues involved with the supply chain design in developing countries are prevalent in developed countries, especially with the rising number of uninsured and jobless among the patient populations and with the budget deficits. Thus the project is a sincere effort in simplifying the tasks of administrators in an easily usable format.

**PROPOSED SYSTEM**

While there has been no consensus on the definition of Pharmacy Supply Management in the literature, they have proposed that researchers adopt the below definition to allow for the coherent development of theory in the area. In order to have a successful supply management, we need to make many decisions related to the flow of information, product, and funds. Each decision should be made in a way to increase the whole supply chain profitability . Supply management is more complex in healthcare and other industries because of the impact on people’s health requiring adequate and accurate medical supply according to the patient’s need.
